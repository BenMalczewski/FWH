Changelog for FWH solver:

monopole validation v2:
-updated methodology for computing dA's, checksum added to make sure all dA's add to the total surface area
-added debug option in fhw.dat to write dA's as p3d file, dA is written twice since my p3d solution writer needs multiple variables to write
-made a slight adjustment in sources.jl, after computing F1 and F2, F1' and F2' are computed, then windowed and FFT'd
	-this was in the Mendez et al. 2013 paper
	-this removes the overshoot in the spectra at low frequencies
	
monopole validation v3:
-changed FWH formulation to Lyrintzis's formulation

Version 0.1.0
-added debug feature that writes vector from surface to observer

Version 0.2.0
-modified fwh.dat file so that grid and solution files do not require same root
-implmented overlapping to FFT, users can now specify a % overlap and number of segments
	-code gives consistent results with different number of segments/overlap, but mirrors directivity
	-added folder showing debug of signalTools.jl toolbox
	
Version 0.2.1
-modified sources.jl and signal tools so that only the magnitude from fft was used
	-differences between positive and negative were not present and directivity was wrong
	-peak magnitude is correct
	
Version 0.2.2
-modified overlappedFFT to output the correct signs for the real and imaginary components
-added option of no window for FFT
-added multipliers to window functions so that the magnitudes come out correctly
-added ijk limits if you dont want to use the entirety of a surface
-flipped direction of vector between source and observer
-created postProcess.jl
	-for now, all it has is a function to sum the surfaces and write the absolute value
	-users need to install "DelimitedFiles" now
	
Version 0.3.0
-changed FWH formulation back to that of Mendez et al. (2013)
	-ran on jet data and gives good agreeance with literature
	-still no disk averaging
	
Version 0.4.0
-moved the script for writing patch solutions to postProcess.jl
-implemented disk averaging
	-users now specify PSI coefficients as described in Mendez et al. (2013)
	
Version 0.4.1
-implemented some additional deallocation lines in the main script

Version 0.5.0
-placed main script into a stand-alone function to hopefully save RAM

Version 0.5.1
-added the use of Memoization package to give better control of function caches
-users now need to add the "Memoization" package

Version 0.5.2
-added more use of the Memoization package and some more RAM saving functionality

Version 0.6.0
-looping through patches is now handled via bash scripting
	-new instance of the code is run with each patch
	-RAM can properly clear after each patch solution
-code now computes grid cutoff frequency based on maximum grid spacing and outputs result

Version 1.0.0
-official release version
-cleaned up FWH.dat file
